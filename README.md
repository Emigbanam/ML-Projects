# Machine Learning & AI Engineering Projects

This repository showcases a collection of **machine learning** and **AI engineering projects**.
Each project highlights practical applications, experiments, and techniques in data science, AI, and deep learning.

The repository will be **regularly updated** with new projects and improvements.

---

## **What You’ll Find Here**

* End-to-end ML projects: data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
* AI engineering experiments: model deployment, optimization, and scaling.
* Research-inspired implementations of algorithms and architectures.
* Notebooks and scripts for reproducibility.

---

## **Structure**

Each project is organized in its own folder with:

* **`README.md`** – project overview and instructions.
* **`notebooks/`** – Jupyter notebooks for exploration.
* **`src/`** – source code and utility scripts.
* **`data/`** – (if applicable) sample datasets or links to datasets.
* **`requirements.txt`** – dependencies for the project.

## **How to Use**

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder of interest:

   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name/project-folder
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
